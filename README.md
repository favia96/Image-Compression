Project 2 - Image Processing - Federico Favia & Yue Song, November 2019, KTH, Stockholm

This project developed within the course of Image and Video Processing at KTH investigates two transform based image compression algorithms, namely the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the fast wavelet transform (FWT). The achievable performances of both transforms are evaluated and compared against each other. See the report for more information.
